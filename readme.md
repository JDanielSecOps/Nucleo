## Installation

Note : I strongly suggest that you install the AppImageLauncher to set Nucleo up properly especially
       when adding Nucleo to the desktop or search menu however you dont need it to simply run the program 
       
For the AppImageLauncher installation kindly refer their

1. Download the AppImage from the <a href="https://github.com/JDanielSecOps/Nucleo/tags">Release</a>
